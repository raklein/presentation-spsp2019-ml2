# Abstract:  
This talk presents results from the Many Labs 2 project, in which pre-registered replications were conducted of 28 psychological effects across 125 samples around the world (total N = 15,305), including translations into 16 different languages. Overall results will be discussed, as well as follow-up analyses and strategies for ensuring robustness of these secondary analyses.
